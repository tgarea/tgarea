## Hey.
I don't use GitHub frequently, as I don't like Microsoft and especially don't like the so called "AI" everywhere.  
However, I still have an account because many good projects are hosted on this platform.
### So where am I?
You can find me on [the small internet](https://the.smallinter.net).
